```assembly
mov ax, 1000h ; Load a large value into AX
mov cx, bx    ; move bx to cx to check for overflow
add ax, bx    ; Add the content of BX to AX
jo overflow_handler ; Jump to overflow handler if overflow occurred
jmp next_instruction ; jump to next instruction

overflow_handler:
; Handle the overflow condition here, perhaps by setting a flag or using a different register
mov dx, ax ; store ax to dx before modifying it. 
;perform necessary error handling or alternative computation
mov ax, dx ;restore value of ax. 
next_instruction:
; Continue program execution
```
This solution incorporates a check for the overflow flag (OF) using the `jo` instruction.  If an overflow occurs, the program jumps to an `overflow_handler` subroutine, which can handle the error appropriately (e.g., display an error message, use a different algorithm, or terminate the program gracefully).  Using larger registers (e.g., DX:AX for 32-bit results) is another way to prevent overflow in some cases.
